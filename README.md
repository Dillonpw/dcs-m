# Dispatcher Cheat Sheet Mobile App

## Introduction

The Dispatcher Cheat Sheet, originally a dynamic web application, is now reimagined as a mobile app! Conceived by a 911 dispatcher, this app started as a simple schedule management tool in vanilla JavaScript. Through its evolution, leveraging technologies such as Astro, TypeScript, and a few React Islands, it has grown into a multifunctional toolkit. With the transition to mobile, we're utilizing Expo Router and NativeWind to deliver a seamless and scalable experience across devices. This adaptation aims to further streamline dispatcher tasks, maintaining its essence of being built by a dispatcher, for dispatchers.
